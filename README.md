# True-Colors
This is a fun little conversation game I made that you can play with your friends. It has a react frontend that uses ChakraUI components. In the backend, it's using express for the endpoints and MongoDB for persistent storage of questions. There are over 600 questions that I have taken from online, other conversational card games, etc. I hope by playing this you can learn a little bit more about the people around you. Enjoy!
