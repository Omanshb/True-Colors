# True Colors
This is a fun little conversation game I made that you can play with your friends. It has a react frontend that uses ChakraUI components. In the backend, it's using express for the endpoints and MongoDB for persistent storage of questions. There are over 600 questions that I have taken from online, other conversational card games, etc. I hope by playing this you can learn a little bit more about the people around you. Enjoy!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
